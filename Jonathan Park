Digital Banking:
Digital Banking represents a shift in the retail banking industry moving away from brick and mortar banks to online banks that do not require physical presence.
The competetive landscape for digital banking is worldwide. Some of the largest digital banks in the world are: Monzo (UK), Chime (USA), Revolut (Russia), Starling (UK), tangerine (Canada), UP (Australia), N26 (Germany), NuBank (Brazil), Doconomy (Sweden), and Neat (Hong Kong).  
The main factors of change that affect this domain are cost and accessibility. Digital banks do not have fixed costs that traditional banks have in the way of real estate and customer facing employees. Also, digital banks are far more accessible than traditional banks. They are not limited to traditional working hours and can be accessed from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection.
The domain is being disrupted by new digital banks that have significantly smaller overhead being able to offer banking services more cheaply, efficiently and consumer friendly.
Technologies used are the internet, mobile communications, cloud storage, artificial intelligence, among others.
Future growth seems limitless as even traditional banks are adopting the digital model. As innovative newcomers continue to drive down costs, other players in the domain will be forced to follow suit or risk being driven out of business. Additionally, creativity is the limiting factor in terms of what new services can be offered and the entire domain will have to compete to offer new and innovative services to customers.
